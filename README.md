Loan Status Prediction(Machine Learning)

Loan status prediction is a machine learning application that helps predict the likelihood of loan applicants defaulting on their payments or being able to repay the loan on time. It involves preprocessing loan applicant data, training a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms, evaluating model performance, and predicting the loan status of new loan applicants. Python offers various libraries and frameworks that can be used to implement loan status prediction models efficiently.
